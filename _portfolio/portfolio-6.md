This was a bit of a recycling project, I had an old computer lying around, a dead laptop, and an old pair of speakers, so this was a good way to reduce on e-waste (even if it did cost an extra £40 in parts, and use £20 of wood)

I bought a joystick set (here)[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005499225108.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.13.5b20kRs9kRs9Qr&algo_pvid=47174b17-ff25-48d4-b1e1-26b1559af80d&algo_exp_id=47174b17-ff25-48d4-b1e1-26b1559af80d-12&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%221%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%2C%22fromPage%22%3A%22search%22%7D&pdp_npi=6%40dis%21GBP%2119.68%2118.89%21%21%21184.79%21177.37%21%40210384cc17582199039432662e7dac%2112000033324812022%21sea%21UK%21892555507%21X%211%210%21n_tag%3A-29919%3Bd%3A1f3e047f%3Bm03_new_user%3A-29895&curPageLogUid=Ciz7VkJou8Rl&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A%7Cx_object_id%3A1005005499225108%7C_p_origin_prod%3A] as well as a board to give the laptop screen an hdmi input.

From there, I made a mockup in solidworks, built the frame, painted it black, and then ran RetroArch on the old computer.
